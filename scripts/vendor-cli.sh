# Runs at prepublish — needs NO submodules and NO playwright build, so the release CI just works.
# Regenerate the inputs with scripts/refresh-vendor-src.sh when the fork changes.

# Layout produced (resolved by resolvePlaywrightCli() in rechrome.ts, priority 3):
#   vendor/playwright-cli/playwright-cli.js                  <- thin wrapper
#   vendor/playwright-cli/node_modules/playwright-core/...   <- patched core (unpacked tarball)
# The wrapper's `require('playwright-core/lib/tools/cli-client/program')` resolves to the nested
# playwright-core via normal Node module resolution.
